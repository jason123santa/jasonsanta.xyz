<p>I thought it would be better if I hosted my own federated social network and owned my data. I can also have my own rules and everything.<br />
Chose to use Pleroma as my software. Mastodon would have also been a good choice but its just more heavy and complex. Besides this is a one or few people instance. Something not as complex is going to be better.</p>
<p>Now I have set everything up correctly. I really like Pleroma and think my instance works great. All I had to do was export my following list from mastodon and then import it to pleroma. Then my instance federated with others and I got all my posts just like on mastodon. Pleroma is light and has the mastodon api so I can use Mastodon clients like Tusky.<br />
If you want to follow me on my own instance I am over on <a href="https://social.jasonsanta.xyz/jason123santa">jason123santa@social.jasonsanta.xyz</a>. Might be changed to something more simple in the future.<br />
My account over at mastodon will still be used along with my Pleroma account but I will end up using Pleroma more.</p>
