<p>I am Jason and I will be starting the 100 days to offload challange today. Coming into this I don’t know what to except but I think I can make it work. Even if I don’t check for grammar mistakes I am still wring about what I want to write about.</p>
<p>Some things to know about me is that I am into FOSS and linux. Got the pinephone in December of 2020. Its one of the best phones I even owned. You might find posts about linux and FOSS or just anything that I want to post for that day. Expect some posts about the Pinephone and other linux phones, Void linux or PopOS.</p>
<p>I am looking foward to posting more on my blog and hope to even teach some people about things they might not have known about.</p>
