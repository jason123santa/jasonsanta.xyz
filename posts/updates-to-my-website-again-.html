<p>Thanks to tdarb over on fosstodon he told me that my website does not look so great on mobile. He told me if I added a viewport tag to my website then it will look better on mobile.<br />
I just added the tag and now it looks great. Then my buttons on my website made my xmpp contact text be all weird. I just moved the stickers up and now it looks fine. If I have any issues later when the buttons i will just move them down.</p>
<p>I think now my website looks great. Looks good on mobile and desktop.</p>
